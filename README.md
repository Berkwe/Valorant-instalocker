# 🛠️ Valorant Instalocker

Valorant Instalocker is an application that uses the Valorant API to quickly lock agents. It runs from the console and its core dependency is the [valclient](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valclient.py) module.

---

## 🆕 New Features v1.7

* **Desktop Shortcut Creation:** You can create desktop shortcuts for specific agents and modes. Running the shortcut allows a quick instalock.
* **Language Support:** Instalocker now supports multiple languages. However, this is an experimental feature, so please report any bugs in the [Issues](https://github.com/Berkwe/Valorant-instalocker/issues) section.  
* **Automatic Language Detection:** The language support includes automatic detection, which may vary depending on your Valorant settings. You can still change it manually using specific commands.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Agent Lock Mode:** Locks the selected agent — classic instalock behavior.
* **Pick Only Mode:** Selects the agent without locking. You do not need to be at the computer while the match is being found.
* **Match Cancel Mechanic:** After an agent is locked, you can cancel the match with a single key press and return to the main menu.
* **Agent Name Shortening:** Shortens long agent names so they can be selected quickly.
* **Automatic Agent Updates:** New agents are added automatically when released.
* **Logging System:** Records errors and makes it easy to report them to the developer.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Agent Selection and Modes

* **Agent Lock Mode:** Locks the agent — classic instalock.
* **Pick Only Mode:** Picks the agent but does not lock it. This allows the match to be found while you are away from the computer.
* **Manual Match Cancel:** Type e/y in the console to cancel.

### ⏩ Using Shortcuts

* To create a desktop shortcut, type E/H at the agent selection screen.
* A shortcut will appear on the desktop according to the agent name and the chosen mode.

### 🚫 Canceling a match through Instalocker:

* After the agent is locked, type e or y in the console to cancel. If you cancel, Instalocker restarts. After the agent is locked, simply type e or y on the console. If you break it, Instalocker will restart, and penalties will still be imposed.

### ✂️ Agent Name Shortening

* A simple mechanic was added so agents can be selected quickly. You may shorten agent names longer than 5 characters, but the typed name must be at least 4 characters.

Example:

```text
✅ brim → valid
❌ reyn → invalid
```

### 🔄 Server Detection

* **Server is detected automatically; manual input is available for exceptional cases.** (If this is unclear, skip it.)

### Automatic Agent Updates

* Instalocker now continuously updates the agent list automatically. However, since this is done by a human, mistakes may occur — in that case, manual update may be required. If so, follow the steps below:

  #### Step 1:

  * Open the CMD (Command Prompt).

  #### Step 2:

  * Paste the following command:

    ```bash
    curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Berkwe/Valorant-instalocker/refs/heads/main/agents.json" > %LOCALAPPDATA%\VALORANT\agents.json
    ```
